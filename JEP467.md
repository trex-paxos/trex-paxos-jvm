# JEP 467: Markdown Documentation Comments

The same javadoc comment can be written by expressing its structure and styling in Markdown, with no use of HTML and just a few JavaDoc inline tags. As an example of the use of Markdown in a documentation comment, consider the comment for java.lang.Object.hashCode:

```java
/// Returns a hash code value for the object. This method is
/// supported for the benefit of hash tables such as those provided by
/// [java.util.HashMap].
///
/// The general contract of `hashCode` is:
///
///   - Whenever it is invoked on the same object more than once during
///     an execution of a Java application, the `hashCode` method
///     must consistently return the same integer, provided no information
///     used in `equals` comparisons on the object is modified.
///     This integer need not remain consistent from one execution of an
///     application to another execution of the same application.
///   - If two objects are equal according to the
///     [equals][#equals(Object)] method, then calling the
///     `hashCode` method on each of the two objects must produce the
///     same integer result.
///   - It is _not_ required that if two objects are unequal
///     according to the [equals][#equals(Object)] method, then
///     calling the `hashCode` method on each of the two objects
///     must produce distinct integer results.  However, the programmer
///     should be aware that producing distinct integer results for
///     unequal objects may improve the performance of hash tables.
///
/// @implSpec
/// As far as is reasonably practical, the `hashCode` method defined
/// by class `Object` returns distinct integers for distinct objects.
///
/// @return  a hash code value for this object.
/// @see     java.lang.Object#equals(java.lang.Object)
/// @see     java.lang.System#identityHashCode
```

(For the purpose of this example, cosmetic changes such as re-flowing the text are deliberately avoided, to aid in before-and-after comparison.)

Key differences to observe:

The use of Markdown is indicated by a new form of documentation comment in which each line begins with /// instead of the traditional /** ... */ syntax.

The HTML <p> element is not required; a blank line indicates a paragraph break.

The HTML <ul> and <li> elements are replaced by Markdown bullet-list markers, using - to indicate the beginning of each item in the list.

The HTML <em> element is replaced by using underscores (_) to indicate the font change.

Instances of the {@code ...} tag are replaced by backticks (`...`) to indicate the monospace font.

Instances of {@link ...} to link to other program elements are replaced by extended forms of Markdown reference links.

Instances of block tags, such as @implSpec, @return, and @see, are generally unaffected except that the content of these tags is now also in Markdown, for example here in the backticks of the content of the @implSpec tag.

## Links

You can create a link to an element declared elsewhere in your API by using an extended form of Markdown reference link, in which the label for the reference is derived from a standard JavaDoc reference to the element itself.

You can link to any kind of program element:

```java
/// - a module [java.base/]
/// - a package [java.util]
/// - a class [String]
/// - a field [String#CASE_INSENSITIVE_ORDER]
/// - a method [String#chars()]
```

To create a link with alternative text, use the form `[text][element]`. For example, to create a link to java.util.List with the text a list, you can write `[a list][List]`. 

Tables

Simple tables are supported, using the syntax of GitHub Flavored Markdown. For example:

```java
/// | Latin | Greek |
/// |-------|-------|
/// | a     | alpha |
/// | b     | beta  |
/// | c     | gamma |
```

## JavaDoc tags

JavaDoc tags, both inline tags such as {@inheritDoc} and block tags such as @param and @return, may be used in Markdown documentation comments:

```java
/// {@inheritDoc}
/// In addition, the methods calls [#wait()].
///
/// @param i the index
public void m(int i) {
    // ...
}
```
